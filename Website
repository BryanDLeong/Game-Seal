Our goal was to create an easily accessible platform where users can enjoy these games during their free time.
During our initial brainstorming sessions, each team member had different games they wanted to include. To accommodate all our ideas, we decided to create a website that combined all of our favorite games. One standout feature of our website is the sidebar, which allows users to effortlessly switch between different games. We utilized Replit to build our website, with each team member focusing on developing a specific game.
Through this project, we applied the HTML, Python, CSS, and JavaScript skills we learned in this program to create a user-friendly gaming website. Beyond the technical skills, we also learned the importance of teamwork and project management, ensuring everything ran smoothly and was completed on time.</p>
